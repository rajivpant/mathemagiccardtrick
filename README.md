### Credits
Thanks to Vijit Sharma and family for introducing Rajiv and Fitz to this math magic trick.
Rajiv and Fitz coauthored the JavaScript here that generates the cards.
Fitz figured out the generalized algorithmic pattern of numbers to be generated that works for each card and for any number of cards.
